# Azure AD - Attack and Defense Playbook

This publication is a collection of various common attack scenarios on Azure Active Directory and how they can be mitigated or detected.
All of the included scenarios, insights and comments are based on experiences from the contributors during their attack simulations, hands-on or real-world scenarios.

It should be considered a living document, which has to be updated as practices progress and changes in attack and defense techniques.
We invite identity or security experts from the community to work together on this publication and contribute updates, feedbacks, comments or further additions.

### Scenarios:
- [Password Spray](PasswordSpray.md)

### In work: Next articles on other scenarios
- Phishing and Illicit Consent Grant
- Hybrid Identity Components
